# Internationalisation

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.19.

## Important Notice
This project was created as an example use case of ButterCMS in conjunction with Angular and internationalisation for the article [Angular Localization: The Why, What, and How](https://buttercms.com/blog/angular-localization-the-why-what-and-how/) and will not be actively maintained. 

If youâ€™re interested in exploring the best, most up-to-date way to integrate Butter into Angular, you can check out the following resources:

### Starter Projects

The following turn-key starters are fully integrated with dynamic sample content from your ButterCMS account, including main menu, pages, blog posts, categories, and tags, all with a beautiful, custom theme with already-implemented search functionality. All of the included sample content is automatically created in your account dashboard when you sign up for a free trial of ButterCMS.
